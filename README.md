The package helps to find and insert bibliography keys. It supports multiple `.bib` files and utilizes fuzzy-finder for searching entries. The package can be used in any scope, making it suitable for files like LaTeX or Python (e.g., PyLaTeX).

## Installation

To install `bib-finder` search for [bib-finder](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/bib-finder) in the Install pane of the Pulsar settings or run `ppm install bib-finder`.

Alternatively, you can run `ppm install bacadra/pulsar-bib-finder` to install a package directly from the Github repository.

## Usage

To use the package, you need a bibliography file in BibTeX format `.bib`. This file should be created and maintained by the user. There are two ways to use it:

* global: You can specify the file path in the package settings.
* local: You can copy the file to the project directory and enable the `bib-finder.bibLocal` flag.

Once you find the entry you want, you can press:
* `Enter` to insert `<key>`
* `Alt-Enter` to insert `\cite{<key>}`
* `Ctrl-Enter` to insert `\cite[]{<key>}`

You can use the special character `@` for searching by type or `#` for searching by key.

## Example of `.bib` file

Here's an example of the content in a bibliography file:

```bib
@book{fhck07,
  author    = "Hartmann, Friedel and Katz, Casimir",
  title     = "Structural Analysis with Finite Elements",
  publisher = "Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",
  address   = "Germany",
  year      = "2007",
  ISBN      = "10-3-540-49698",
}
