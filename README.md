The package helps to find and insert bibliography keys. It supports multiple `.bib` files and utilizes fuzzy-finder for searching entries. The package can be used in any scope, making it suitable for files like LaTeX or Python (e.g., PyLaTeX).

## Installation

### Atom Text Editor

The official Atom packages store has been [disabled](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/). To obtain the latest version, please run the following shell command:

```shell
apm install bacadra/atom-bib-finder
```

This will allow you to directly download the package from the GitHub repository.

### Pulsar Text Editor

The package is compatible with [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) and can be installed using the following command:

```shell
ppm install bacadra/atom-bib-finder
```

Alternatively, you can directly install [bib-finder](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/bib-finder) from the Pulsar package store.

## Usage

To use the package, you need a bibliography file in BibTeX format (`.bib`). This file should be created and maintained by the user. There are two ways to use it:

* Globally: You can specify the file path in the package settings.
* Locally: You can copy the file to the project directory and enable the `bibLocal` flag.

Once you find the entry you want, you can press:
* `Enter` to insert `<key>`
* `Alt-Enter` to insert `\cite{<key>}`
* `Ctrl-Enter` to insert `\cite[]{<key>}`

You can use the special character `@` for searching by type or `#` for searching by key.

## Example of `.bib` file

Here's an example of the content in a bibliography file:

```bib
@book{fhck07,
  author    = "Hartmann, Friedel and Katz, Casimir",
  title     = "Structural Analysis with Finite Elements",
  publisher = "Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",
  address   = "Germany",
  year      = "2007",
  ISBN      = "10-3-540-49698",
}

@book{stng51,
  author    = "S. Timoshenko and J. N. Goodier",
  title     = "Theory of elasticity",
  publisher = "{McGRAW-HILL BOOK Company Inc.}",
  address   = "New York, Toronto, London",
  year      = "1951",
}
```
