* globally - you need write file path in package settings,
* locally - copy file to project directory. `bibLocal` flag must be ticked ON.

If you find entry you want, then you can press:
* `Enter` to insert `<key>`
* `Alt-Enter` to insert `\cite{<key>}`.
* `Ctrl-Enter` to insert `\cite[]{<key>}`.

The special character `@` can be used for search by type or `#` for search by key.
